The original source code of nanovg.c was changed slightly:
  - nvgText was changed to round vertex positions to reduce text blurring
  - A GCC pragma was added to suppress a warning in stb_image

Changes to fontstash.h
  - Increased memory size for newer stb_truetype version
  - Removed pixel snapping from fons__getQuad
  - Include <malloc.h> as malloc and free weren't found for some reason
