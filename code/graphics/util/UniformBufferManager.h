 * @brief A class for managing uniform buffers for a specific block type
 *
 * This class can be used for retrieving an unused uniform buffer for a specific uniform block type. External code
 * should use gr_get_uniform_buffer instead of creating an instance of this class.
 *
 * @details This system uses fence sync objects for detecting if a buffer is still in use. By using those objects it is
 * possible to avoid any synchronization operations when updating the buffer data.
