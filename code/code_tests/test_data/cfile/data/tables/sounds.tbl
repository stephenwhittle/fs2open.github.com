;  If a sound entry appears in this file, there is a hook into the game to
;  play the sound.  This file can only be modified to change *existing* sounds.
;  Talk to a programmer if you want to add brand new sounds.  Adding a line to
;  this file will not make your sound appear in the game, it will more than
;  likely break something.
;
; 	If you don't want the sound to play, put none.wav as the sound to play.
;
;	The fields for a sound entry are:
;	1) unqiue sound signature
;	2) filename of the sound
;	3) flag to indicate sound should always be pre-loaded before a mission
;	4) the default volume (from 0.0 -> 1.0)
;	5) 0 - not 3d  1 - stereo 3D  2 - Aureal A3D (if available), otherwise use stereo 3D
;	6) distance at which sound starts to attenuate (for 3d sounds only)
;	7) distance at which sound is inaudible (for 3d sounds only)
;
