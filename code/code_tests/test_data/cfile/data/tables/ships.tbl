;  file to indicate all ship types and their physical characteristics (such as physics info, etc)
;  format is a simple form of the mission files
;
;  Some general comments about some of the fields
;
;  Velocities are specified in (freespace) units/second.  You can currently only
;  specify velocities in the linear directions.  Rotational velocities are still
;  currently speified with thrust (until I get this fixed).  Rotation time is the
;  amount of time (in seconds) to complete 1 revolution in the given direction
;  (x is pitch, y is heading, and z is bank).
;
;  Damp affects how quickly you will accel/decal to your target velocity.  Higher damp
;  means slow acceleration and deceleration.  The lower this number, the faster 
;  the ship responds.   For example, specifying a value of 0.0 means there is no
;  damping, in other words, people would say, "this has no physics, like Wing
;  Commander."   The more damping, the harder to control, but the more smoothly
;  it moves.
;
;  Accelerations:
;   All the acceleration numbers are damp factors for how fast the thing 
;   changes speed.   0 would mean instantaneous velocity changes, and the
;   bigger the number, the slower the acceleration.  Sort of backwards, but...
;   forward_accel - The damp factor for when the ship is trying to go faster
;   forward_decel - The damp factor for when the ship is trying to slow down
;   slide_accel - The damp factor for left/right/up/down/reverse acceleration.
;   slide_decel - The damp factor for left/right/up/down/reverse deceleration.
;
;	Energy Transfer System:
;	$Power Output		=>	energy is produced per second by the ship's reactor
;   $Max Oclk Speed		=>	the max forward speed of the ship when 100% energy
;									is directed at the engines
;   $Max Weapon Eng		=>	how much weapon energy can be stored (related to $Energy Cosumed
;									field in weapons.tbl)
;
;	Afterburners:
;	 $Afterburner			=> YES if afterburner present, NO otherwise
;
;	 The following parameters must be present if $Afterburner is YES, otherwise comment
;   out or delete them:
;
;	+Aburn Max Vel:			=> x,y,z velocity when afterburner engaged
;	+Aburn For accel:		=> forward accel when afterburner engaged
;	+Aburn Fuel:			=> fuel capacity of afterburners
;	+Aburn Burn Rate:		=> rate in fuel/second that afterburners consume fuel
;	+Aburn Rec Rate:		=> rate in fuel/second that afterburners recover fuel

;  If you don't want to assign a sound, put -1 as the index.

   John Explains Physics:

   $Density doesn't affect physics except in the case of collisions.

   $Damp is how fast your velocity vector "clamps" onto your forward
   vector.   0.0 is instantaneous, the bigger, the slower.  So, for 
   all you people that want velocity different than heading, set this
   number to 10.0 or something and give it a try.  

   $Rotdamp is how "loose" your turning is.   The bigger the looser.
   For instance, 0.0 would be what people consider "no physics".  A
   Mustang Cobra, for instance, would be about 0.1 and a 1965 Cadillac
   with flat tires would probably pull a good 1.0...  You probably won't
   get any satisfaction changing this.

   $Max Velocity is obvious except there are three numbers which mean
   left/right slide, up/down slide, and forward speed.  Reverse speed
   in $Rear Velocity.

   $Rotation time is how long it would take you to turn all the way 
   around when turning full force and neglecting the $RotDamp 
   accelerations.  In other words, if you hold hown, left turn and
   turn around three times, this would be how long the 2nd rotation
   took.   The only funny thing here is it goes pitch, heading, bank.

   $Forward accel is how fast your ship can accelerate to your desired
   speed.  Like $Damp, it means, how fast your actual velocity "clamps"
   to your desired velocity.  0.0 would be instantaneous, bigger is 
   slower.
   
   $Forward decel is about the same as $Forward accel except it is how
   fast you can slow down.  Hoffoss- Putting 100.0 here would make it
   so you couldn't stop of your own VOLITION, unless you turned the
   opposite direction and applied thrust.  That would be an OUTRAGE! --MK

$Name:				@GTS Centaur
$Short name:		TSup
$Species:			Terran
+Tech Description:
The Centaur support ship is designed to get in and out of battle as quick as possible.  It is fast, and quite maneuverable, allowing it to dock with fighters in a minimum amount of time.  Most notable about the Centaur, however, is its extremely large explosion radius.  The amount of warheads carried on a support ship makes it very dangerous to be close to an exploding Centaur.

The mainstay of the Terran Fleet, these vessels have served in both strike and defense purposes.  From nose to tail it measures 260 meters.  With a full array of weapon systems and a strong enough hull to withstand the strongest enemy warheads, a Fenris Cruiser can be found in almost any system that the GTA is operating in.  The Fenris cruiser was originally designed as a strike weapon, hence its fast speed and decent turning rate.  It was later decided that a second line of cruisers would be produced, for defensive purposes, once it became apparent that the V-T war wouldn't be over in a few months.

$Name:				GTC Leviathan
$Short name:		TMDBCruise
$Species:			Terran
+Tech Description:
After the Vasudans began making incursions into GTA space, command decided that it needed a new defensive cruiser.  Changes to the Fenris led to the GTC Leviathan line of cruisers, produced as mobile defense battleships.  Their speed and maneuverability were greatly reduced in tradeoff for more powerful weapons and a stronger hull.  Production was discontinued when the GTA thought they would win the Vasudan war after the Battle of Gulnara, and then the production was started up again after the defeat at the Talania system.  Because of the on-again off-again nature of this vessel's production, almost all of the Leviathan Cruisers have different armaments, but all have consistent hulls and speeds.

$Name:				GTSC Faustus
$Short name:		TSci1
$Species:			Terran
+Tech Description:
The Faustus Science vessel was, and still is, a civilian craft. However, in the 14 years since the Terran-Vasudan war began, more and more of these were commissioned by the GTA in order to pursue military research.  However, its obvious value, poor fighting capabilities, and lack of speed make it a prime target for enemy ships; hence, you will rarely find many of these anywhere near the front lines of battle.

$Name:				GTD Orion
$Short name:		TCap
$Species:			Terran
+Tech Description:
The Orion is the capital ship of the GTA.  Measuring a frightening 2.1 kilometers in length, the cost to build one of these far outweighs the cost of paying the crew of this ship for 3 years.  There is no more important symbol of Terran Pride than a ship like the Galatea or the Intrepid cruising past a colonized planet, patrolling the system and ensuring safety.  In the course of the 14 year war, very few of these have ever been lost, making the destruction of an Orion a truly horrible defeat.

$Name:				GTI Arcadia
$Short name:		TInst
$Species:			Terran
+Tech Description:
Early Terran space stations were constructed much smaller, and were mostly used for Zero-G research purposes.  Later on, with advancements in space construction technologies, stations grew bigger and bigger.  When the first Arcadia-class station was commissioned, GTA decided to rename it to an Installation rather than a Space Station.  Used for a variety of purposes, almost all major systems are home to at least one Installation, which is often used as the center of trade and communications.  Home to scores of small ship, including repair vessels, fighters, and transports, an Arcadia class Installation is always a safe haven for a convoy of attack ships, returning from battle.  Where the Orion is the symbol of Terran power, the Arcadia is the shining beacon of stability.

;=====>> VASUDANS <<=======
$Name:				@PVF Anubis
$Short name:		VFight
$Species:			Vasudan
+Type:				Light Skirmish
+Maneuverability:	Good
+Armor:				Light
+Manufacturer:		PVN
+Description:
Lowest power Vasudan craft. Offers little
in the way of offensive or defensive capabilities.
Best used in swarm situations.
$end_multi_text
+Tech Description:
The Anubis is the weakest fighter in the Vasudan Navy.  However, they are extremely cheap to manufacture, and are often used in swarm situations to try to overwhelm the opponent with numbers.  A few radical Vasudans have been known to load the ship with explosives and attempt to steer themselves into GTA capital ships.  The first occurrence of this was the battle of Rexias 4, where the GTD Goliath was destroyed by a squadron of kamikaze pilots.
Due to its lack of afterburners and low weapon capacity, the GTA has classified the Anubis as a class D threat.

$Name:				@PVF Seth
$Short name:		VFight7
$Species:			Vasudan
+Type:				Heavy Fighter

+Manufacturer:		PVN
+Description:
Slow and sluggish, but heavily armored.
Has high afterburner speed.  Useful for
hit and run attacks.  High payload capacity.
$end_multi_text
+Tech Description:
As the slowest fighter in the PVN, the Seth has earned itself a reputation as the Turtle of the Vasudan fleet.  Even though it is quite compact in size, the Seth can carry a massive payload, and has a lot of shielding.  Its standard impulse engines aren't very powerful, but the Seth gains an incredible speed boost when using its afterburners.  The Seth is primarily used is convoy attacks and capital ship escort duties.
The GTA considers the PVF Seth to be a Class C threat.

The Horus interceptor can outrun any ship in the PVN or the GTA.  This makes it extremely dangerous.  Its above average weapons capacity, combined with its good maneuverability and shielding make this one of the most well designed Interceptors in the galaxy.  This ship is responsible for the destruction of more GTA bombers than any other.
As a C class threat, Horus interceptors should be dealt with as quickly as possible.

$Name:				PVF Thoth
$Short name:		VFight9
$Species:			Vasudan
+Type:				Advanced Space Superiority
+Maneuverability:	Excellent
+Armor:				Light
+Manufacturer:		PVN/Hammer Of Light
+Description:
Excellent fighter.  Small and hard to hit,
with speed and maneuverability to match.  Good
payload makes it the most versatile fighter in
the PVN.
$end_multi_text
+Tech Description:
The Thoth is the most dangerous ship to be created by the PVN.  Manufactured solely at the Altairian Ship Yards, the Thoth has only been produced in small numbers as of yet.  When the Altairian Yards defected to the Hammer of Light rebels, the production of Thoths by the PVN dropped to nil.  The Thoth is now completely in the hands of the Hammer of Light.
What makes the Thoth so versatile is its small size, extremely high maneuverability, and advanced weapon systems.  It is extremely difficult to hit, in the hands of a skilled pilot.  The design for the Thoth was simultaneous with the design for the Ulysses, and these two ships were designed by some of the same technicians.  Thus they are quite a match for our Ulysses class fighters.  This is why they are considered a B class threat.  Any non registered Thoths should be destroyed immediately, and their presence reported upon completion of the mission.

$Name:				PVB Osiris
$Short name:		VBomb6
$Species:			Vasudan
+Type:				Bomber
+Maneuverability:	Poor
+Armor:				Heavy
+Manufacturer:		PVN
+Description:
Low maneuverability and low top speed.  However,
carries good payload including space bombs. Most
commonly used in cruiser strikes.
$end_multi_text
+Tech Description:
The Osiris has now become the standard bomber for use in PVN operations.  It has replaced the Amun, correcting many of the faults of its predecessor.  It is not quite as sturdy, but it has nearly the same weapons capacity, and is faster and more maneuverable.
The Osiris should be considered a C class threat to Fenris class cruisers, and a D class threat otherwise.

$Name:				PVB Amun
$Short name:		VBomb7
$Species:			Vasudan
+Type:				Heavy Bomber
+Maneuverability:	Very Poor
+Armor:				Heavy
+Manufacturer:		PVN
+Description:
Lowest maneuverability and extremely low top speed.
Moving target, but the heaviest bomber in the PVN.
Used against capital ships.
$end_multi_text
+Tech Description:
The Amun is the Vasudans heaviest bomber class ship.  It carries a massive payload and has been responsible for the destruction of at least 3 Orion class destroyers in the past 2 years.  Fortunately, it is slow and has low maneuverability, making it an easy target for our fighters.  Fighter pilots should be wary of the two turrets on this ship: they are not to be ignored.
The Amun is considered a B class threat to all cruisers and capital ships.  They should be given top priority in target selection during escort operations.

$Name:				PVS Scarab
$Short name:		VSup
$Species:			Vasudan
+Tech Description:
The Scarab is very similar to our Centaur: We believe the Vasudans stole the design of this ship from us.  It is used for in flight rearming of fighters and bombers.  In longer engagements, these ships can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  The major difference between this ship and the Centaur is that the Scarab is unmanned.

$Name:				PVT Isis
$Short name:		VTran

+Tech Description:
The Isis transport is quite fast and maneuverable for a ship of its size.  Most often it is used for personnel transfer, although occasionally they have been known to act as repair ships and tugboats.  It is well protected with its turrets, and it is not unheard of for the PVN to use a wing of Isises to conduct an assault on a fortified position.

$Name:				@VC 3
$Short name:		TCar1
$Species:			Vasudan
+Tech Description:
The standard Vasudan cargo container is only slightly different from our own.  The primary difference is that the Vasudan cargo containers are atmospheric as well as deep-space.  Vasudans used cargo containers well before we did, as they needed to transport raw materials from other systems to their own barren world.  Our cargo container was modelled after theirs, although ours is slightly superior in durability.

$Name:				PVFR Satis
$Short name:		VFreight4
$Species:			Vasudan
+Tech Description:
The dreaded Satis freighter was thought to be a warship when it was first encountered in the Aldebaran Encounter.  It has five turrets and a strong hull, making it quite dangerous to the inexperienced pilot.  However, most experienced pilots in the GTA know enough to attack the Satis' main weakness: its weak plating around the turrets.  Disarming a Satis is most often the best way to destroy it.
While capturing supply ships is often an intelligent plan, the Satis has been considered dangerous enough to rank as a Class C threat.  Treat it as one.

$Name:				PVC Aten
$Short name:		VCruise2
$Species:			Vasudan
+Tech Description:
The Aten class cruiser, while far stronger than most of the Vasudans warships, falls short as a attack cruiser.  It does not have the armor or the firepower to stand up to GTA weaponry.  With a cruiser speed of 25 m/s and only six weapon turrets, the Aten just cannot muster the kind of firepower needed to do real damage to targets of size.
Most GTA pilots have learned to exploit the primary weakness of the Aten: its extremely weak weapons subsystem.
The Aten class cruiser is considered by the GTA to be a Class B threat.

$Name:				PVD Typhon
$Short name:		VDestroy
$Species:			Vasudan
+Tech Description:
Where the Aten cruiser failed, the Typhon succeeded well past expectations.  The Typhon is an incredible work of engineering and the model of Vasudan technology.  When the first one was sighted at the Vega Engagement, it was laughed at by our technicians as a foolish display of non utilitarian design.  The subsequent destruction of the GTD Eisenhower and the total decimation of the 4th fleet changed their minds very quickly.  The Typhon should never be underestimated.  It wields massive weaponry, and has more armor plating than any Terran Destroyer.  Its only known weakness is its turret armor, which is significant, but lower than expected.  In the two years since this ship first appeared, we have only managed to destroy two of them.
The Typhon is considered a Class A threat to any ships within the same system.  Do not engage without backup.

$Name:				SF Dragon
$Short name:		SFight
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
The Shivan Dragon is easily the most impressive fightercraft we have yet seen.  Its maneuverability is unmatched, and it has quite a few other advantages, including a good top speed, powerful afterburners, and strong shields.  It is the only Shivan fighter we have been able to study up close, and we have learned a great deal about Shivan engineering from it.
It seems that the Shivan shield systems are extremely strong, but their hulls are far weaker than our own.  They also rely on primary weapons far more then secondaries, as evidenced by the Dragon's small capacity.
The GTA considers the Dragon as a Class A threat.

We believe that the Manticore is a Shivan interceptor.  It has a very high top speed, and its maneuverability is quite good.  However, its shield system isn't strong enough to withstand constant fighting for long, which leads us to believe the Manticore's primary purpose is to destroy enemy bombers.
The Manticore ranks as a Class B threat.

$Name:				SF Scorpion
$Short name:		SFight12
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
We originally thought the Scorpion was the Shivans best fighter.  However, we now believe that the Scorpion is nothing more than a Shivan scout ship.  Their vast numbers and seeming unimportance to the Shivan war effort leads us to this belief.  Regardless of its purpose, the Scorpion is highly maneuverable, fast, and difficult to destroy.  It can also do damage equivalent to our space superiority fighters.
In the event that you encounter Scorpions, regard them as a Class C threat.

$Name:				SB Shaitan
$Short name:		SBomb1
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
The Shaitan bomber is only slightly superior to our own bombers - it's shielding is better, but its capacity seems to be far worse.  Perhaps the Shivans were so assured that they would only need one payload to destroy a target.
We consider the Shaitan to be a Class C threat.

$Name:				SB Nephilim
$Short name:		SBomb8
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
The Nephilim class bomber is the most alien of the Shivan ships.  We are still unsure as to why the Shivans chose this odd shape for arguably their most powerful attack craft.  However, with four primary cannons and two turrets, as well as a massive payload, the Nephilim is undoubtedly a serious threat to the GTA.  We have already lost two Orion class destroyers to a wing of Nephilims.  Unless we learn a weakness soon, we will most likely lose two more.
The Nephilim has been designated a Class A threat to GTA destroyers and cruisers.  In unpopulated systems, it is to be considered a Class B threat.

$Name:				ST Azrael

+Tech Description:
The Azrael is most likely a Shivan transport.  While we are not completely sure of its uses, we do know that they can house many Shivans.  It is not very heavily armored, and its weaponry is not too strong.  This makes the Azrael the most common target for capture attempts.

$Name:				SC Lilith
$Short name:		TCruise3
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
While far more rare than its counterpart, the Cain-class cruiser, the Lilith is one of the most ferocious cruisers we have had the misfortune of combating.  It has extremely strong weapon systems, as well as a very thick armor which our cannons can barely penetrate.  One for one, the Lilith can easily destroy any of our cruisers.  It is for this reason that they should be considered a primary target for all bomber squadrons in the GTA.
The Lilith should be considered a Class A threat to any ships that encounter it.

$Name:				SC Cain
$Short name:		TStrCruise
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
The Cain is by far the most common cruiser in the Shivan fleet.  It is also the weakest.  However, the Cain should not be underestimated.  It has many turrets, as well as a cluster bomb defensive mechanism.  As a strike cruiser, the Cain mostly appears in attacks against GTA or PVN capital ships and cruisers.  In these cases, it should be destroyed immediately.  The primary weakness of the Cain appears to be its unshielded turrets.  Most of the turrets on the Cain can be destroyed with minimal damage.
The Cain is a Class B threat.

$Name:				SD Demon
$Short name:		SDestroyer
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
While the Demon-class Destroyer is easily one of the most massive ships we have yet seen, it is not the biggest or most powerful in the Shivan armada.  However, it is still quite dangerous, with a plethora of missile turrets and two full squadrons of fighters.  It is suggested that these capital ships be destroyed by bombers, as all cruisers that have attempted to engage a Demon have been destroyed.
The Demon is a Class A threat in any allied system.

$Name:				SD Lucifer
$Short name:		SSuperD
$Species:			Shivan
+Tech Description:
The Lucifer is the greatest threat to the survival of the GTA, the PVN, and both the Terran and Vasudan species.  It wields three massive Flux Cannons which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits.  These same cannons have been seen bombarding colonized worlds.  With four full fighter squadrons, and a massive array of defensive turrets, the Lucifer would be extremely difficult to destroy.
The fact that it is protected by a sheath shielding system which makes it completely impervious to any kind of kinetic or plasma damage makes it impossible to destroy.  We have yet to find a way to breach this shielding technology.  It is hoped that a solution will be found soon.
Assuming that a solution is found, we have managed to gather enough data on the Lucifer to destroy it.  In a recon mission, we were able to determine that the Lucifer is powered by five reactors across its surface.  If these reactors are destroyed in a short amount of time, the Lucifer will be stopped.
If we cannot stop the Lucifer, we do not expect to be able to defeat the Shivans.
We have no way of knowing if there are more than one Lucifer-class destroyer.  However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a Class A threat.
