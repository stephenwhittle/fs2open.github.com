;	ai.tbl

; This file specifies AI class behavior for each skill level.
; We have five skill levels: Trainee, Rookie, Hotshot, Ace, Insane.
; (We should come up with better names.)
; We have a virtually unlimited number of AI classes.  If you add a new AI class and
; you get an execution error about too many classes, increase MAX_AI_CLASSES, defined
; in ai.h.  On Jan. 30, 1997, MAX_AI_CLASSES = 50.
