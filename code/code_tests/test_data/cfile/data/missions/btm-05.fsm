#Messages		;! 211 total


$Name: Start of Mission
$Message: All right.  First we'll cover use of the aspect seeking Interceptor missiles.  Note that you are fully equipped with Interceptors.
+Wave Name: btm5_01.wav

$Name: Explain Seeker 1
$Message: Unlike heat seeking missiles, such as the MX-50, you must acquire a lock on your target in order for an aspect seeker to home.
+Wave Name: btm5_02.wav

$Name: Explain Seeker 2
$Message: However, the aspect seeker is well worth this effort, as its homing ability is much stronger.
+Wave Name: btm5_03.wav

$Name: Explain Seeker 3
$Message: Once fired, the aspect seeker will track its target anywhere in space.  Once the heat seeker loses track of its target, it is not likely to reacquire lock.
+Wave Name: btm5_04.wav

$Name: Arrive Freighter 1
$Message: Freighter 1 is now entering.  Let's see how you do with those Interceptors.
+Wave Name: btm5_05.wav

$Name: Attack Hornet
$Message: Target the freighter. [Press $H$]
+Wave Name: btm5_06.wav

$Name: Attack Hornet 2
$Message: Notice the red indicator moving towards your target.  That's the Aspect Diamond.  Once it has moved onto your target, you'll see the lock indicator.  This indicates your Interceptors are locked and ready to fire.
+Wave Name: btm5_07.wav

$Name: Fire at Hornet
$Message: Now, fire one Interceptor at the freighter.
+Wave Name: btm5_08.wav

$Name: Hornet Description
$Message: Note how fast the Interceptor moves.  They also deliver quite a payload.
+Wave Name: btm5_09.wav

$Name: Hornet Desc 2
$Message: Note that the Interceptor is nearly useless if fired before lock as been attained.  This is a crucial difference between the Interceptor and the MX-50.
+Wave Name: btm5_10.wav

$Name: Hornet Subsys
$Message: Now, target the Weapons subsystem on the freighter. [Press $S$ until targeted.]
+Wave Name: btm5_11.wav

$Name: Hornet Subsys 2
$Message: Good.  Now, wait until you have attained lock on the Weapons subsystem.
+Wave Name: btm5_12.wav

$Name: Destroy Weapons
$Message: Now, fire your Interceptors until the Weapons subsystem has been destroyed.
+Wave Name: btm5_13.wav

$Name: Weapons Destroyed
$Message: Well done.  Note your Interceptors will be effective in destroying subsystems on large targets.
+Wave Name: btm5_14.wav

$Name: Destroy Freighter 1
$Message: Now, unload your Interceptors until you've destroyed Freighter 1.
+Wave Name: btm5_15.wav

$Name: Freighter 1 Destroyed
$Message: Excellent job.  Now it's time to destroy some moving targets.
+Wave Name: btm5_16.wav

$Name: Hornet Desc 1a
$Message: A round of Interceptors can be fired every 3 seconds.  Fire another round and note the countdown timer in your Weapons Gauge.
+Wave Name: btm5_17.wav

$Name: Describe Shield
$Message: Your ship is equipped with the new shielding technology.  It is able to absorb a large amount of incoming weapon energy.
+Wave Name: btm5_18.wav

$Name: Describe Shield 2
$Message: As the shield absorbs damage, it becomes weaker.  However, it automatically regenerates itself over time.
+Wave Name: btm5_19.wav

$Name: Describe Shield 3
$Message: Your shield integrity gauge is located at the lower right of your HUD.  It is flashing now.
+Wave Name: btm5_20.wav

$Name: Describe Shield 4
$Message: Your shield is divided into four quadrants, each able to withstand a certain amount of damage.
+Wave Name: btm5_21.wav

$Name: Shield Quadrant Show
$Message: When a quadrant of your shield suffers damage, the corresponding section of your Shield Integrity gauge will flash.  Observe.
+Wave Name: btm5_22.wav

$Name: Shield Damage Front
$Message: Note the front of your shield is flashing as if you've taken damage.
+Wave Name: btm5_23.wav

$Name: Shield Damage Front Much
$Message: Note how the gauge changes as your shield takes more damage.  When a shield quadrant has been destroyed, all damage will pass through to the underlying hull.
+Wave Name: btm5_24.wav

$Name: Shield Repairs
$Message: Note that your shield automatically recharges over time.  I will accelerate this process to save time.
+Wave Name: btm5_25.wav

$Name: Shield Repairs Watch
$Message: Now observe as the front quadrant of your shield repairs itself to full strength.
+Wave Name: btm5_26.wav

$Name: Shield Repairs Done
$Message: Now your shield has recharged back to full strength.  Next we'll cover shield management.
+Wave Name: btm5_27.wav

$Name: Shield Equalize Explain
$Message: There are a number of ways you can manage your shield.  The simplest is the Equalize Quadrants function.
+Wave Name: btm5_28.wav

$Name: Shields Equalized Well Done
$Message: Well done.  Note that your front section has been largely recharged.  This came at the expense of shield energy from the three other quadrants.
+Wave Name: btm5_29.wav

$Name: Shield Damage Front Again
$Message: I have damaged your front shield quadrant again.  Now use your Equalize Quadrants function to repair your front quadrant.  [Press $q$]
+Wave Name: btm5_30.wav

$Name: Shield Damage 3 Quadrants
$Message: I'm now going to reduce most of your shield strength.  Note that three of your four quadrants are now near zero strength.
+Wave Name: btm5_31.wav

$Name: Shield Maximize Quadrant
$Message: Now you'll learn how to maximize shield strength in a specific quadrant.
+Wave Name: btm5_32.wav

$Name: Shield Maximize Front
$Message: First, you'll maximize the strength in your front quadrant.  [Press $Up Arrow$ several times.]
+Wave Name: btm5_33.wav

$Name: Shield Front Maximized
$Message: Well done.  Note that your front quadrant is at full strength, while the others were drained.
+Wave Name: btm5_34.wav

$Name: Shield Front Maximized 2
$Message: Maximizing your front shield quadrant is especially useful when you're attacking a large ship against its turret fire.
+Wave Name: btm5_35.wav

$Name: Shield Maximize Rear
$Message: Now I want you to maximize your rear shield quadrant.  [Press $Down Arrow$ several times.]
+Wave Name: btm5_36.wav

$Name: Shield Rear Maximized
$Message: If you're pursuing an important objective and are being attacked from the rear, maximizing your rear shield quadrant can be very useful.
+Wave Name: btm5_37.wav

$Name: All Finished
$Message: Well done, Pilot.  Aspect seeking missiles are an important part of your arsenal.  Use them well.
+Wave Name: btm5_38.wav

$Name: All Finished 2
$Message: And proper shield management can make all the difference in a crucial battle.
+Wave Name: btm5_39.wav

$Name: All Finished 3
$Message: This concludes your training.  Return to base.
+Wave Name: btm5_40.wav

$Name: Discuss Moving Targets
$Message: In order to gain aspect lock on a moving target, you must keep the target's lock box in a fixed location inside your HUD reticle.
+Wave Name: btm5_41.wav

$Name: Talk About Drones
$Message: I will now call in fighter drones.  When the first drone enters, target it and acquire lock.  Try to keep the target indicator in the center of your HUD reticle.
+Wave Name: btm5_42.wav

$Name: Destroy First Drone
$Message: Once you have acquired lock, fire an Interceptor to destroy the drone.  Note, these drones will not be using countermeasures.
+Wave Name: btm5_43.wav

$Name: Killed Last Drone
$Message: Well done.  Now let's try something a little more difficult.  Wings of two drones will appear at once.  Destroy them all.
+Wave Name: btm5_44.wav

$Name: Killed DroneB
$Message: All right.  Now we'll move on to your shield system.
+Wave Name: btm5_45.wav

$Name: Kill DroneB a
$Message: Note that you'll need to be in range of these drones before you can gain aspect lock.  Fly towards them.
+Wave Name: btm5_46.wav

$Name: Suggest Rearm
$Message: You're low on Interceptors. You should rearm soon. [Press $Shift-R$]
+Wave Name: btm5_47.wav
